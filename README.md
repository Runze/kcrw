An analysis of the most played artists on KCRW
====

The whole project was documented in this post [here](http://www.runzemc.com/2014/06/an-analysis-of-the-most-played-artists-on-kcrw.html). The finished app can be accessed [here](https://runzemc.shinyapps.io/shiny/).

Besides the web crawl code used to crawl the playlists from [kcrw](http://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/eclectic24), the server, ui, and data used to make the shiny app are saved in the `playlist` folder.

Please refer to the official shiny [tutorial](http://shiny.rstudio.com) if you'd like to learn more about making shiny apps (best tuturial ever!).

Have fun :-)
